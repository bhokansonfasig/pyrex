Module containing antenna classes responsible of receiving signals.

These classes are intended to model the properties of antennas including
how signals are received as well as the production of noise. A number of
attributes like directional gain, frequency response, and antenna factor
may be necessary to calculate how signals are manipulated upon reception by
an antenna.

    """
    Class for half-wave dipole antennas.

    Stores the attributes of an antenna as well as handling receiving,
    processing, and storing signals and adding noise. Uses a first-order
    butterworth filter for the frequency response. Includes a simple threshold
    trigger.

    bandwidth : float
        Bandwidth (Hz) of the antenna.

        voltage of the antenna noise.
    orientation : array_like, optional
        Vector direction of the z-axis of the antenna.
    trigger_threshold : float, optional
        Voltage threshold (V) above which signals will trigger.

        Effective length (m) of the antenna. By default calculated by the tuned
        `center_frequency` of the dipole.
    noisy : boolean, optional
        Whether or not the antenna should add noise to incoming signals.
    unique_noise_waveforms : int, optional
        The number of expected noise waveforms needed for each received signal
        to have its own noise.

    threshold : float, optional
        Voltage threshold (V) above which signals will trigger.
    effective_height : float, optional
        Effective length of the antenna. By default calculated by the tuned
        `center_frequency` of the dipole.

        Coefficients of the transfer function of the butterworth bandpass
        filter to be used for frequency response.
    noisy : boolean
        Whether or not the antenna should add noise to incoming signals.
    unique_noises : int
        The number of expected noise waveforms needed for each received signal
        to have its own noise.
    freq_range : array_like
        The frequency band in which the antenna operates (used for noise
        production).
    temperature : float or None
        The noise temperature (K) of the antenna. Used in combination with
        `resistance` to calculate the RMS voltage of the antenna noise.
    resistance : float or None
        The noise resistance (ohm) of the antenna. Used in combination with
        `temperature` to calculate the RMS voltage of the antenna noise.
    noise_rms : float or None
        The RMS voltage (V) of the antenna noise. If not ``None``, this value
        will be used instead of the RMS voltage calculated from the values of
        `temperature` and `resistance`.
