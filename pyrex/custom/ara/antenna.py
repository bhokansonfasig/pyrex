        Process and store an incoming signal.

            the antenna. If ``None`` no directional response will be applied.
        polarization : array_like, optional
            Vector denoting the signal's polarization direction. If ``None``
            no polarization gain will be applied.
        force_real : boolean, optional
            Whether or not the frequency response should be redefined in the
            negative-frequency domain to keep the values of the filtered signal
            real.
