A Python package for simulation of neutrinos and radio antennas in ice.

PyREx (\ **Py**\ thon package for an IceCube **R**\ adio **Ex**\ tension)
is, as its name suggests, a Python package designed to simulate the
measurement of Askaryan pulses via a radio antenna array around the IceCube
South Pole Neutrino Observatory. The code is designed to be modular so that
it can also be applied to other askaryan radio antennas (e.g. the ARA and
ARIANNA collaborations).
