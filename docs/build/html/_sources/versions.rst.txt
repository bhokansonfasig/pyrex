.. currentmodule:: pyrex

Version 1.8.0
=============

.. rubric:: New Features

* Added model of the ARIANNA LPDA based primarily on the implementation in `NuRadioReco <https://github.com/nu-radio/NuRadioReco>`_.

* Added :attr:`Antenna.is_hit_mc` and :attr:`AntennaSystem.is_hit_mc` which test noise-only triggers to determine whether a triggered antenna as truly triggered by signal or not.

* Added ``require_mc_truth`` argument to :meth:`Detector.triggered` to toggle whether a true Monte Carlo signal trigger (described above with :attr:`Antenna.is_hit_mc`) is required for a detector trigger.

* Added :attr:`AntennaSystem.lead_in_time` which allows front-end systems time to equilibrate before waveforms are recorded.

.. rubric:: Changes

* :attr:`Antenna.waveforms` and :attr:`Antenna.all_waveforms` now include all relevant signals in the waveform during that time, similar to :meth:`Antenna.full_waveform`.

* :meth:`ARAAntenna.interpolate_filter` moved to :meth:`ARAAntennaSystem.interpolate_filter`, since this better matches the logical location of the front-end electronics.

.. rubric:: Bug Fixes

* Fixed error in calculation of ARA Hpol polarization gain.

* Corrected amplification of :class:`ARAAntennaSystem` (previously was silently ignored).

* Corrected tunnel diode and other triggers to use standard deviation from mean rather than rms.

* Fixed accidental duplication of antennas when :meth:`Detector.build_antennas` is called more than once.

* Fixed numerical issue when checking that antenna axes are perpendicular.



Version 1.7.0
=============

.. rubric:: New Features

* Moved :mod:`pyrex.custom.ara` module into main PyREx package instead of being a plug-in.

* All docstrings now follow numpy docstring style.

* Added particle types and interaction information to :class:`Particle` class.

* Added :class:`Interaction` classes :class:`GQRSInteraction` and :class:`CTWInteraction` for defining different neutrino interaction models. Preferred model (:class:`CTWInteraction`) aliased to :class:`NeutrinoInteraction`.

* Added :meth:`ShadowGenerator.get_vertex`, :meth:`ShadowGenerator.get_direction`, :meth:`ShadowGenerator.get_particle_type`, :meth:`ShadowGenerator.get_exit_points`, and :meth:`ShadowGenerator.get_weight` methods for generating neutrinos more modularly.

* Added :class:`Event` class for holding a tree of :class:`Particle` objects. :class:`Event` objects are now returned by generators and the :class:`EventKernel`.

* Added :class:`ZHSAskaryanSignal` class for the Zas, Halzen, Stanev parameterization of Askaryan pulses. Mostly for comparison purposes.

.. rubric:: Changes

* :meth:`ShadowGenerator.create_particle` changed to :meth:`ShadowGenerator.create_event` and now returns an `Event` object.

* Generator classes moved to :mod:`pyrex.generation` module.

* :class:`Signal.ValueTypes` changed to :class:`Signal.Type` to match :class:`Particle.Type` and :class:`Interaction.Type`.

* :class:`FastAskaryanSignal` changed to :class:`ARVZAskaryanSignal`. This class is still the preferred parameterization aliased to :class:`AskaryanSignal`.

* Arguments of :class:`AskaryanSignal` changed to take a :class:`Particle` object rather than taking its parameters individually.

* Removed unused :class:`SlowAskaryanSignal`.

* Now that :class:`AskaryanSignal` can handle different particle and shower types, secondary particle generation was added to determine shower fractions: :attr:`NeutrinoInteraction.em_frac` and :attr:`NeutrinoInteraction.had_frac`.

* Changed IREX envelope antennas to be an envelope front-end on top of an ARA antenna. Results in :class:`IREXAntennaSystem` becoming :class:`EnvelopeHpol` and :class:`EnvelopeVpol`.



Version 1.6.0
=============

* Added shell scripts to more easily work with git branching model.

.. rubric:: Changes

* :class:`ShadowGenerator` ``energy_generator`` argument changed to ``energy`` and can now take a function or a scalar value, in which case all particles will have that scalar value for their energy.

* :class:`EventKernel` now uses :class:`pyrex.IceModel` as its ice model by default.

* :meth:`Antenna.receive` method (and :meth:`receive` method of all inheriting antennas) now uses ``direction`` argument instead of ``origin`` argument to calculate directional gain.

* :meth:`Antenna.clear` and :meth:`Detector.clear` functions can now optionally reset the noise calculation by using the ``reset_noise`` argument.

* :class:`Antenna` classes can now set the ``unique_noise_waveforms`` argument to specify the expected number of unique noise waveforms needed.

* :meth:`ArasimIce.attenuation_length` changed to more closely match AraSim.

.. rubric:: Performance Improvements

* Improved performance of :func:`slant_depth` calculation.

* Improved performance of :meth:`IceModel.attenuation_length` calculation.

* Using the :class:`Antenna` ``unique_noise_waveforms`` argument can improve noise waveform calculation speed (previously assumed 100 unique waveforms were necessary).

.. rubric:: Bug Fixes

* Fixed received direction bug in :class:`EventKernel`, which had still been assuming a straight-ray path.

* Lists in function keyword arguments were changed to tuples to prevent unexpected mutability issues.

* Fixed potential errors in :class:`BasicRayTracer` and :class:`BasicRayTracePath`.



Version 1.5.0
=============

.. rubric:: Changes

* Changed structure of :class:`Detector` class so a detector can be built up from strings to stations to the full detector.

* :attr:`Detector.antennas` attribute changed to :attr:`Detector.subsets`, which contains the pieces which make up the detector (e.g. antennas on a string, strings in a station).

* Iterating the :class:`Detector` class directly retains its effect of iterating each antenna in the detector directly.

.. rubric:: New Features

* Added :meth`Detector.triggered` and :meth:`Detector.clear` methods.

* Added two new neutrino generators :class:`ListGenerator` and :class:`FileGenerator` designed to pull pre-generated :class:`Particle` objects.

.. rubric:: Bug Fixes

Version 1.3.0
=============

.. rubric:: New Features

* Added and implemented :class:`ReflectedPathFinder` class for rays which undergo total internal reflection and subsequently reach an antenna.


.. rubric:: Changes

* Change :class:`AksaryanSignal` angle to always be positive and remove < 90 degree restriction (Alvarez-Muniz, Romero-Wolf, & Zas paper suggests the algorithm should work for all angles).

Version 1.2.0
=============

.. rubric:: Changes

* Changed :mod:`custom` module to a package containing :mod:`irex` module.

* :mod:`custom` package leverages "Implicit Namespace Package" structure to allow plug-in style additions to the package in either the user's ``~/.pyrex-custom/`` directory or the ``./pyrex-custom`` directory.



Version 1.1.2
=============

* Added :meth:`IREXAntenna.front_end_processing` method for processing envelope, amplifying signal, and downsampling result (downsampling currently inactive).


.. rubric:: Changes

* Change :meth:`Antenna.make_noise` to use a single master noise object and use :meth:`ThermalNoise.with_times` to calculate noise at different times.

    * To ensure noise is not obviously periodic (for <100 signals), uses 100 times the recommended number of frequencies, which results in longer computation time for noise waveforms.

    * Current value types are :attr:`ValueTypes.undefined`, :attr:`ValueTypes.voltage`, :attr:`ValueTypes.field`, and :attr:`ValueTypes.power`.

    * :class:`Signal` objects now must have the same :attr:`value_type` to be added (though those with :attr:`ValueTypes.undefined` can be coerced).


.. rubric:: Changes

* Made units consistent across PyREx.

* Added ability to define :class:`Antenna` noise by RMS voltage rather than temperature and resistance if desired.

* Allow :class:`DipoleAntenna` to guess at :attr:`effective_height` if not specified.

=============

.. rubric:: New Features

* Added :mod:`custom` module to contain classes and functions specific to the IREX project.



Version 1.0.2
=============

.. rubric:: New Features

* Added :meth:`Antenna.make_noise` method so custom antennas can use their own noise functions.


.. rubric:: Changes

* Allow passing of numpy arrays of depths and frequencies into most :class:`IceModel` methods.

    * :meth:`IceModel.gradient` must still be calculated at individual depths.

* Added ability to specify RMS voltage of :class:`ThermalNoise` without providing temperature and resistance.

* Removed (deprecated) :meth:`Antenna.isHit`.


.. rubric:: Performance Improvements

* Allowing for :class:`IceModel` to calculate many attenuation lengths at once improves speed of :meth:`PathFinder.propagate`.

* Introduced :class:`IceModel` alias for :class:`AntarcticIce` (or any future preferred ice model).

* Moved :meth:`AntarcticIce.attenuationLengthMN` to its own :class:`NewcombIce` class inheriting from :class:`AntarcticIce`.

* Added :meth:`PathFinder.propagate` to propagate a :class:`Signal` object in a customizable way.

* Changed naming conventions to be more consistent, verbose, and "pythonic":

    * :meth:`AntarcticIce.attenuationLength` becomes :meth:`AntarcticIce.attenuation_length`.

    * In :mod:`pyrex.earth_model`, :const:`RE` becomes :const:`EARTH_RADIUS`.
