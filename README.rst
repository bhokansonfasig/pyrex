PyREx - (\ **Py**\ thon package for **R**\ adio **Ex**\ periments)
***************************************************************************

PyREx (\ **Py**\ thon package for **R**\ adio **Ex**\ periments) is a Python package designed to simulate the measurement of Askaryan pulses via in-ice radio antenna arrays.
The code was written for the ARA collaboration with considerations for future radio arrays.
As such, the package is designed to be highly modular so that it can easily be used for other radio projects (e.g. ARIANNA, RNO, and IceCube Gen2).

Getting Started
===============

Requirements
------------

PyREx requires python version 3.6+ as well as numpy version 1.17+, scipy version 1.4+, and h5py version 3.0+.
After installing python from https://www.python.org/downloads/, the required packages can be installed with ``pip`` as follows, or they will be installed automatically by simply installing PyREx as specified in the next section.

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install numpy>=1.17
    pip install scipy>=1.4
    pip install h5py>=3.0

Installing
----------

The easiest way to get the PyREx package is using ``pip`` as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install git+https://github.com/bhokansonfasig/pyrex#egg=pyrex

Note that since PyREx is not currently available on PyPI, a simple ``pip install pyrex`` will not have the intended effect.

If you wish to install PyREx to an arbitrary directory, instead of the local ``site-packages`` directory (e.g. if you're a dev and you want to prototype some changes), you can also install PyREx via cloning the repository and manually installing:

.. code-block:: shell

    cd [dir where you want source code to live]
    git clone https://github.com/abigailbishop/pyrex.git .
    python -m pip install --user --editable pyrex

Optional Dependencies
---------------------

The following packages are not required for running PyREx by default, but may be useful or required for running some specific parts of the code:

`matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recommended version: 3.0+

Used for creating plots in example code and auxiliary scripts.

`sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ and `numpydoc <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recommended version: 3.0+, 1.0+

Required for building documentation. Only needed by documentation maintainers and release handlers.

`PySpice <https://pyspice.fabrice-salvaire.fr>`_
