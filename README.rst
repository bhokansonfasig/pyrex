PyREx - (\ **Py**\ thon package for an IceCube **R**\ adio **Ex**\ tension)
***************************************************************************

PyREx (\ **Py**\ thon package for an IceCube **R**\ adio **Ex**\ tension) is, as its name suggests, a Python package designed to simulate the measurement of Askaryan pulses via a radio antenna array around the IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory.
The code is designed to be modular so that it can also be applied to other askaryan radio antennas (e.g. the ARA and ARIANA collaborations).

Getting Started
===============

Requirements
------------

PyREx requires python version 3.6+ as well as numpy version 1.13+ and scipy version 0.19+.
After installing python from https://www.python.org/downloads/, numpy and scipy can be installed with ``pip`` as follows, or by simply installing pyrex as specified in the next section.

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install numpy>=1.13
    pip install scipy>=0.19

Installing
----------

The easiest way to get the PyREx package is using ``pip`` as follows

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install git+https://github.com/bhokansonfasig/pyrex#egg=pyrex

Note that since PyREx is not currently available on PyPI, a simple ``pip install pyrex`` will not have the intended effect.
